# WhileDB
rust implementation of [While-DB](https://github.com/HellOwhatAs/While-DB), the programming language used in SJTU CS2612 (2022 Fall) Attachment 1014

## TODO
- [x] find a way to omit `;` after `}`
  currently unable to add `;`, however
- [x] add function
- [x] make any expression callable (currently only `ident` callable)
- [x] add class and method
- [x] add `[` `]` to represent array and getitem
- [x] add string
- [ ] add interpreter or compiler
  > any object (including the program state) can be represented as `Any`, pointer to `WdAny`
  > `WdAny` is either `Object` or `Function`
  > `Object` has 2 fields `buildin` (store buildin types or `Not`) and `attrs`(a string to `Any` map)
  > `Function` is either build-in or defined
  >
  > state store 
  > - types (object with `"__name__"` => typename, and `"__method_name__"` => method function)
  > - instances (object with `"__type__"` => type object)
  > - functions ...

  > state = `{ <locals>, "__nonlocals__": {<nonlocals>} }` ðŸ˜Ž

## Future Work
- [x] python binding: [WhileDB.rs](https://github.com/HellOwhatAs/WhileDB.rs)
- [ ] wasm
